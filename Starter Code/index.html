    <!--My misson statement, or my "Why" is very important to me and a powerful mission is key to succeeding in finding purpose-->
    <h2 class="center">My "Why":</h2>
    <p>I believe that everyone is capable of greatness. My greatness comes from inspiring others to be the absolute best versions of themselves.
      I find that the best way to inspire others is to lead by example, so I push myself to be better every day. </p>

      <h3 class="center">Background:</h3>
      <p>I am a 27 year old professional who has been interested in computers and software engineering since highschool.
        I taught myself basic HTML and CSS on Khan Academy first, then took a semester of web
        development in high school where I solidified my knowledge of the previous languages and also learned a bit of 
        Adobe Dreamweaver. Since leaving high school, I have continued my interest in technology by watch content creators on Youtube
        talk about computer hardware, and I even purchased a few courses of software development through the Udemy platform.
